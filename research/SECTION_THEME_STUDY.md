# CordalSur section-theme study

## Claim boundary

This implementation is evidence-informed, not evidence of a biochemical response. Automated checks can prove palette coverage, contrast, reflow and deterministic theme behavior. Only a preregistered study with people can support a causal claim about satisfaction, attraction or intention to reuse CordalSur.

## Design hypothesis

Each guest section keeps the CordalSur forest, gold and ivory foundation while receiving one restrained semantic accent. The accent changes between light and dark so selected controls retain at least a 6:1 text contrast ratio. Information, labels and status never depend on color alone.

The intervention is motivated by three findings:

1. Tractinsky, Katz and Ikar found that interface aesthetics affected post-use perceptions of aesthetics and usability. This supports testing perceived usability, but does not prove actual task performance. DOI: <https://doi.org/10.1016/S0953-5438(00)00031-X>
2. Lavie and Tractinsky identified classical and expressive dimensions of perceived web aesthetics and developed measures for them. DOI: <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijhcs.2003.09.002>
3. Hall and Hanna experimentally found that higher text/background contrast generally improved readability; color combinations affected aesthetic ratings and behavioral intention, but not retention. DOI: <https://doi.org/10.1080/01449290410001669932>

The accessibility floor follows WCAG 2.2 success criteria 1.4.3, 1.4.11 and 1.4.10: <https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/>

## Preregistered comparison

- **Design:** randomized, counterbalanced, within-participant comparison.
- **Control:** the previous uniform CordalSur palette.
- **Treatment:** the section-adaptive palette in `data/section-palettes.json`.
- **Tasks:** find Wi-Fi, identify check-in guidance, choose a restaurant, find an activity, read weather, locate ski tickets, review check-out and find emergency guidance.
- **Primary outcome:** mean perceived visual-aesthetics score after completing all tasks.
- **Secondary outcomes:** task success, time on task, error count, perceived usability and intention to reuse.
- **Scale:** use the published Lavie-Tractinsky classical and expressive aesthetics items under the instrument's applicable permissions; record reuse intention separately on a 7-point scale.
- **Sample size:** recruit 80 participants to retain at least 72 complete paired sessions, targeting 0.80 power for a standardized paired effect of 0.35. Do not change the sample after seeing results.
- **Analysis:** mixed-effects model with participant as a random intercept, palette as the fixed effect, order as a covariate, 95% confidence intervals and effect sizes. Correct secondary comparisons with Holm's method.
- **Exclusions:** preregister technical failures and incomplete sessions; report every exclusion and missing value.
- **Accessibility:** record device, theme, age band and self-reported color-vision limitations; do not exclude color-vision variation merely to improve the result.

## Decision rule

Adopt the claim “the section palette improves attraction” only when the treatment improves the primary outcome with its confidence interval above the preregistered smallest effect of interest, while task success is non-inferior and error rate does not worsen. Otherwise report the result as inconclusive or negative.

The current automated result supports only this statement: all ten sections have distinct light/dark identities, every selected-state text pair is at least 6:1, and the generated CSS matches the declared palette data.
